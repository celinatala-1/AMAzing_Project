# AMazing Project
This was a project for a course where my group and I had to write an algorithm for a maze simulation. T user can choose a maze diffiulty up to level 9 and up to 10 avatars. After which, the program will connect to a remote server, which sends back a maze for the program to solve. The maze is "solved" when all avatars end up in the same location. The GUI will print out the maze at each step with the upated avatar locations.

### Requirements
* Access to the remote server

### Implementation

To build, run `make`.

To clean up, run `make clean`.

For instructions on how to run the maze, see the README.md file in the amstartup directory.

Unfortunately my school has closed the server connection, so I am unable to run the  program anymore.
